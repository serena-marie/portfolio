It also uses local storage to replenish Redux store and persist the applications state across sessions. My inspiration for this project was that while using the Pomodoro technique, there were features I was craving - the need to add 5 more minutes to a timer to wrap up work, the desire to visual the pomodoro in a timeline format. I'm continuing to work on this to make these features possible, but it is deployed as a minimal timer.",
